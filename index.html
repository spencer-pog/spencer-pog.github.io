	<h2>About Me: </h2>
	 
	<p> I am currently a doctoral student in the <a href="https://linguistics.osu.edu/">Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University</a>. </p>
	  
	<p> My primary research focus is theoretical morphology, especially paradigm structure and morphological complexity. 
    I am also interested in examining broader morphosyntactic phenomena in Spanish as a whole and in individual dialects. 
    I study these topics using quantitative and corpus methods. My recent master's thesis, 
	<a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/3203433204?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses">Dialectal Variation and Morphological Complexity: A Study of Spanish Verbal Systems</a>, 
    examined and compared the inflectional complexity of Spanish dialects using multiple complexity measures.</p>

	  <p> I received my MA in Linguistics from San Diego State University in 2025,
    and my BA in Linguistics, with a secondary major in Spanish Studies,
    from Brigham Young University in 2022. </p>
